  # Create Call
  # Creates an outbound phone call.  All calls are initially queued. Your outbound calls will initiated at a specific dequeueing rate, enabling your application to \&quot;fire and forget\&quot; when creating calls. Queued calls may not be modified until they are dequeued and placed, but may be removed from your queue on demand.  &lt;b&gt;Please note:&lt;/b&gt; Calls submitted to your queue will be placed approximately in order, but exact ordering is not guaranteed.

  # Get Call State Information
  # Retrieve the current state of a specific call.

If you attempt to retrieve information for a call that is older than 7 days, you will get an HTTP 404 response.
